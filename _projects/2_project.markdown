I work with [Prof. Leyla Ismayilova](https://crownschool.uchicago.edu/crownscholars/l-ismayilova){:target="\_blank"} to study and build effective interventions for youth leaving institutional care.

**Mental Health Prevention Program for Institutionalized Children**

This research project aims to adapt, refine and test three evidence-based interventions to improve mental health outcomes of children from orphanages in Azerbaijan. Due to the economic crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan hosts a population of “social orphans,” children left by destitute parents in state-run orphanages or residential institutions. Years of separation or loss of parents, traumatic experiences such as physical abuse by orphanage staff, and lack of supportive and caregiving adults often result in severe emotional and behavioral problems among institutionalized children. Currently there are no evidence-based, culturally adapted mental health prevention interventions available for children with a history of institutionalization in Azerbaijan and other former Soviet Union countries. CHAS-funded pilot studies adapted and tested the feasibility of family strengthening prevention intervention for children reintegrating back into the community. The NICHD-funded clinical trial will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and test which of three different approaches could best assist children reintegrating from institutions with their families: (a) a group-based family strengthening intervention; b) screening and linkage to mental health services; and c) an asset-based economic empowerment program providing savings accounts for children to help their families save for education, housing, or small business start-ups.
