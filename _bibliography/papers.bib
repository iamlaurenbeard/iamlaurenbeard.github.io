  title={Association of Prenatal Exposure to Population-Wide Folic Acid Fortification With Altered Cerebral Cortex Maturation in Youths},
  abstract={Presently, 81 countries mandate the fortification of grain products with folic acid to lessen the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Epidemiologic data on severe mental illness suggest potentially broader effects of prenatal folate exposure on postnatal brain development, but this link remains unsubstantiated by biological evidence. The results of this study suggest an association between gestational exposure to fortification of grain products with folic acid and altered cortical development and, in turn, with reduction in the risk of psychosis in youths.},

  title={Cortical abnormalities in bipolar disorder: an MRI analysis of 6503 individuals from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group},
  abstract={Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) is still not well understood. Structural brain differences have been associated with BD, but results from neuroimaging studies have been inconsistent. To address this, we performed the largest study to date of cortical gray matter thickness and surface area measures from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of 6503 individuals including 1837 unrelated adults with BD and 2582 unrelated healthy controls for group differences while also examining the effects of commonly prescribed medications, age of illness onset, history of psychosis, mood state, age and sex differences on cortical regions. In BD, cortical gray matter was thinner in frontal, temporal and parietal regions of both brain hemispheres. BD had the strongest effects on left pars opercularis (Cohen’s d=−0.293; P=1.71 × 10^−21), left fusiform gyrus (d=−0.288; P=8.25 × 10^−21) and left rostral middle frontal cortex (d=−0.276; P=2.99 × 10^−19). Longer duration of illness (after accounting for age at the time of scanning) was associated with reduced cortical thickness in frontal, medial parietal and occipital regions. We found that several commonly prescribed medications, including lithium, antiepileptic and antipsychotic treatment showed significant associations with cortical thickness and surface area, even after accounting for patients who received multiple medications. We found evidence of reduced cortical surface area associated with a history of psychosis but no associations with mood state at the time of scanning. Our analysis revealed previously undetected associations and provides an extensive analysis of potential confounding variables in neuroimaging studies of BD.},

  title={Left medial orbitofrontal cortical thinning is associated with negative symptom severity in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis by the ENIGMA-Schizophrenia consortium},
  abstract={Our understanding of the complex relationship between schizophrenia symptomatology and etiological factors can be improved by studying brain-based correlates of schizophrenia. Previous research has shown that impairments in executive functioning, which have been associated with prefrontal brain areas (particularly in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC)), give rise to negative symptoms. Here we tested the hypothesis that MOFC thickness is associated with negative symptom severity. This study included 1 985 individuals with schizophrenia from seventeen research groups around the world contributing to the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group. MOFC thickness values were obtained from T1-weighted structural brain scans using FreeSurfer. A meta-analysis was conducted over effect sizes from a model predicting mean left or right MOFC thickness by negative symptom score (harmonized SANS or PANSS scores). Secondary models were run to investigate the effects of antipsychotic medication, duration of illness, overall illness severity, and handedness. Meta-analytical results showed that left MOFC thickness was significantly associated with negative symptom severity (βstd=−0.075; p=0.019) after accounting for age, gender and site. This effect remained significant (p=0.036) in a model including overall illness severity. Covarying for duration of illness, antipsychotic medication or handedness weakened the association of negative symptoms with left MOFC thickness. Using an unusually large cohort and a meta-analytical approach, our findings point towards a link between prefrontal thinning and negative symptom severity in schizophrenia. This finding provides further insight into the relationship between structural brain abnormalities and negative symptoms in schizophrenia.},

  title={Positive symptoms associate with cortical thinning in the superior temporal gyrus via the ENIGMA-Schizophrenia consortium},
  abstract={Based on the role of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in auditory processing, language comprehension and self-monitoring, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between STG cortical thickness and positive symptom severity in schizophrenia. This prospective meta-analysis includes data from 1,987 individuals with schizophrenia collected at seventeen centers around the world that contribute to the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group. STG thickness measures were extracted from T1-weighted brain scans using FreeSurfer. The study performed a meta-analysis of effect sizes across sites generated by a model predicting left or right STG thickness with a positive symptom severity score (harmonized SAPS or PANSS positive scores), while controlling for age, sex, and site. Secondary models investigated relationships between antipsychotic medication, duration of illness, overall illness severity, handedness and STG thickness. Positive symptom severity was negatively related to STG thickness in both hemispheres (left: βstd=−0.052; p=0.021; right: βstd=−0.073; p=0.001) when statistically controlling for age, sex and site. This effect remained stable in models including duration of illness, antipsychotic medication or handedness. Our findings further underline the important role of the STG in hallmark symptoms in schizophrenia. These findings can assist in advancing insight into symptom-relevant pathophysiological mechanisms in schizophrenia.},
