Iâ€™m Lauren, a Sociology PhD Student at the University of Chicago. I use mixed methods approaches to study mental health with marginalized youth and young adults.

Prior to coming to UChicago, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with degrees in Neuroscience and Modern Middle Eastern Studies in 2017. Follwing that, I worked as a Data Analyst at the Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center.   

In my spare time, I like to ride my bike, read and write poetry, and support mutual aid projects in my local community.
