Hello, and welcome to my work-in-progress website! 

I'm Lauren, a [Sociology PhD Student at the University of Chicago](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/lauren-beard){:target="\_blank"}. I use mixed methods approaches to study mental health with marginalized youth and young adults.   

Prior to coming to UChicago, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with degrees in Neuroscience and Modern Middle Eastern Studies in 2017. From 2017-2018, I worked as a Data Analyst at the [Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center](https://www.pennlinc.io/research){target="\_blank"}.   

In my spare time, I like to ride my bike, read and write poetry, and support mutual aid projects in my local community.
