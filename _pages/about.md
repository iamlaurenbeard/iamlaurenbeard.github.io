Hello, and welcome to my work-in-progress website!   

I'm Lauren, a Sociology PhD Student at UChicago. I use mixed methods approaches to study mental health with marginalized youth and young adults. Prior to coming to UChicago, I graduated from UPenn with degrees in Neuroscience and Modern Middle Eastern Studies.   

In my spare time, I like to ride my bike, read and write poetry, and support mutual aid projects in my local community.
